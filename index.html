        <strong>Relating to 21-03-17 <small>(YY-MM-DD)</small> downtime and update changes:</strong><br>
        The GT7 server is down for maintenance right now. (A critical issue in the v1.07 update, apparently.)<br>
        Meanwhile, the internet has been melting down not just because of that but also due to the credit reward changes in said update.<br>
        If you haven't seen, the most efficient way to grind is now less than half as efficient as it was before.<br>
        <a href="#v107-reward-changes">(A list of reward changes is available below.)</a><br>
        <br>
        This moves the cars in the Legend Cars Dealership further out of reach for those of us with less time to play.<br>
        Of course, I disagree with this change: legendary cars were hard enough to obtain as is, and I was expecting/hoping that rewards would increase<br>
        (so that more difficult events would match the Fishermans Ranch event in value, expanding player choice for "grinding").<br>
        But this hasn't happened, and instead we're here.<br>
        Perhaps PD will "change their mind" as they continue their rush to build v1.08, but I doubt it.<br>
        <br><br>
        <strong>As the server is down as of the time of this site updating:<br>
        All changes for today are based on the estimates.<br>
        If the server comes back (and I get around to updating the site), it'll be corrected to match reality.</strong><br>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Normal info and changelog follows:</strong><br>
        The GT7 server updates dealerships at 00:00 UTC.<br>
        This page is manually updated and may be out of date: check the last updated string next to each section.<br>
        Note: Names are displayed in English with non-ASCII characters removed or replaced with alternatives.<br>
        <br>
        15/03/22 update:<br>
        - A NEW label has been added to cars that weren't in that dealership yesterday.<br>
        - Day counters have been added: showing estimates while in regular stock, and time remaining for limited stock.<br>
        Coming soon:<br>
        - more content, as seen in each section below the dealerships.<br>
        In the far future:<br>
        - pages to view historic dealership info.<br>
        - pages to see a car's price history.<br>

      You may see some cars before the ones displayed here.<br>
      These come from the menu book you currently have active.<br>
      A list of these menu book specific used cars can be found <a href="#menu-book-used-section">here</a>. (coming soon)<br>
      <br>
      The displayed estimates assume cars will be available for 7 days after they appear.<br>
      This is not always true (hence, estimate) - note that cars ARE always "Limited Stock" for 2 days, however.<br>
      "Estimate: Limited Stock Soon" is displayed for cars that are lasting longer than estimated.<br>

      Also, GT7 uses different BoP. However, it should be roughly similar (for cars that were in GT Sport).
